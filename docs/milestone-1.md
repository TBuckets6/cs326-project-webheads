# Application Idea

When learning a new subject, it can sometimes be hard to find a resource that allows you a way to truly test your knowledge. This website aims to be a one of those helpful resources to solidify your understand of various topics.

There will be a user interface that lets users take quizzes on different topics. We are planning to design these quizzes about categories including math and programming.

Certain data to be included is questions to be asked as well as answers, and a score accumulator which lets you know how you fared. There will also be a diffculty setting as well as choosing what topic you want to be tested on. If you're feeling up for a challenge, you can opt to select a time limit of your choice. Finally there will be a way to give feedback to the designer if there is a bug or if you think the answer given is incorrect.

# Functionality

When the user arrives at the website, they will first be given the options to choose their topic, adjust the difficulty, and set an optional time limit. These may be implemented via a dropdown list. Once the settings have been chosen, the user will click a button to start the quiz. There will be input text boxes for short answer and radio buttons multiple choice. When finished with the quiz, the user will receive their total score as well as the correct answer to each question.

Data:
- Questions/Answers - String
- Difficulty Settings - Number
- Scores - Number
- Topic Categories - String, Object
- Optional Time limit - Boolean, Number, Time
- User Feedback - String
